DESIGN AND SIMULATION OF A UNIVERSITY CAMPUS NETWORK USING CISCO PACKET TRACER 

•Universities rely heavily on the proper functioning and analysis of their networks to support education,
administration, communication, e-library services, automation, and more. An efficient network is essential for
the systematic and cost-effective transfer of information within the organization, including messages, files, and
shared resources.
•This project provides insights into key networking concepts such as topology design, IP address configuration,
and the transmission of data packets across wired networks in different areas of a university campus.
